Analysis of the Scores of VAE, GAN and Diffusion Model

PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):

The GAN model has the highest PSNR (18.9526), indicating it provides the best image quality.
The VAE follows with 12.1438, while the Diffusion model has a slightly higher PSNR than VAE at 13.2363, but still significantly lower than the GAN.

MSE (Mean Squared Error):

The GAN model also has the lowest MSE (0.0174), suggesting it has the least error in image reconstruction.
The VAE has a higher MSE (0.0650) which is better than the Diffusion model (0.1899).

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index):

Again, the GAN model has the highest SSIM (0.6481), indicating it preserves the structural integrity of images better than both the VAE and Diffusion models.
The VAE shows a modest SSIM (0.1592), while the Diffusion model has a very low SSIM (0.0002), indicating poor structural similarity.

Conclusion
Based on the average values of scores of models made by me, the GAN model is clearly the best choice for underwater image enhancement in my case, 
as it outperforms both the VAE and Diffusion models in all key metrics (highest PSNR and SSIM, lowest MSE).
